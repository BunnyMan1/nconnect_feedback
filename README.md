# Wiredash Example  
  
This project uses the default Flutter sample project and adds the Wiredash widget to enable interactive user feedback - luckily that's easy as 1-2-3 ðŸŽ‰

## What are the differences from the official Flutter sample?

Inside `main.dart` the default `MaterialApp` is now a child of `Wiredash`. It's important that Wiredash sits at the root of your application for it to function properly.

We also added an `IconButton` as the only action to the `AppBar` which serves as the trigger for the feedback routine. In its callback it calls `Wiredash.of(context).startFeedback()` to launch Wiredash.

## Running the Sample

1. Create a new Wiredash project on [wiredash.io](https://wiredash.io).
2. Make sure to add your own API credentials to the `Wiredash` widget inside `main.dart`.
3. Run the sample by typing `flutter run` into a console window inside the `example` folder.
4. Inside the sample app, tap the `?` button on the top right to launch Wiredash.
5. Get creative and write / draw your first feedback ðŸ–Œ
