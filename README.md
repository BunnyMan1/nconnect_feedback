Wiredash is probably the easiest, and most convenient way to capture in-app user feedback, wishes, ratings and much more. The SDK is completely written in Dart and runs on Android, iOS, Desktop and the Web. For more info, head over to [wiredash.io](https://wiredash.io). 
  
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

> **TIP**  Visit [docs.wiredash.io](https://docs.wiredash.io/guide/#integrating-wiredash-in-your-app) for the in-depth guide and additional info.

### 1. Create a free account on [wiredash.io](https://console.wiredash.io)

Sign in with a valid Google or GitHub account.

### 2. Add wiredash to your pubspec.yaml.

```yaml
name: your_flutter_app
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  wiredash: ^0.6.0
```

### 3. Wrap your root widget with Wiredash

Fill in the `projectId` and `secret` from [Wiredash console](https://console.wiredash.io) > Project > Settings

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:wiredash/wiredash.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // It's important that Wiredash and your root Material- / Cupertino- / WidgetsApp
  // share the same Navigator key.
  final _navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Wiredash(
      projectId: 'YOUR-PROJECT-ID',
      secret: 'YOUR-SECRET',
      navigatorKey: _navigatorKey,
      child: MaterialApp(
        navigatorKey: _navigatorKey,
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        home: YourSuperDuperAwesomeApp(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 4. Launch the feedback flow

From anywhere in your app

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  // launch wiredash where appropriate in your App 
  onPressed: () => Wiredash.of(context).show(),
  child: Text('Give Feedback'),
),
```
